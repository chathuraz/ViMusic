Experience your music like never before with ViMusic Fork, an enhanced, ad-free music player powered by YouTube Music. Stream any song, play offline, and dive into a world of music without limitsâ€”all with a beautiful, customizable, and privacy-focused interface.

This special fork builds upon the original ViMusic with powerful new features you won't find anywhere else!

--- THE ULTIMATE LYRICS EXPERIENCE ---

Go beyond simple line-by-line lyrics! This fork offers true word-level synchronized lyrics, turning your phone into a karaoke machine. Lyrics are intelligently cached after the first load, so they appear instantly and are available offline, all while saving your data.

--- IMPORT FROM ANYWHERE ---

Tired of being locked into one service? With our new Generic CSV Import feature, you can easily import your playlists from Spotify, Apple Music, or any other service that can export to a CSV file. Migrating your music library has never been easier.

--- UNMATCHED RELIABILITY ---

We've replaced the core playback engine with the battle-tested engine from NewPipe. This means a more stable, reliable connection to music streams, with significantly fewer playback errors and interruptions.
